# Starter mental model suggestions

Mental models are a **core** Hindsight feature. Pi Hindsight provisions them through use-profile-aware bank templates (guided setup or `/hindsight` → `t`), then injects non-empty model content into automatic context.

## Placement decision

Starter suggestions live here and in `extensions/banks/bank-templates.ts` (keep in sync). Applying a bundled template creates these models via Hindsight's bank-template import endpoint — dry-run gated, confirm before write. Arbitrary mental-model authoring remains in the Hindsight control-plane web UI.

For quality criteria and when agents should **propose** create/update/refresh (never silent), see [Mission and mental-model quality](mission-and-mental-model-quality.md).

## Product rules

- Suggestions are explicit opt-in (setup/TUI), never silent bank mutation on every boot.
- Creation shows name, bank, source query, and tags before submission.
- **Agent use** selects which seed set applies: `coding` vs `conversation` (real-life / chat agents).
- Tags on seeds must be a subset of retain tags (`source:pi`) so refresh is not empty.
- When models have content, automatic context injects them ephemerally under `<hindsight-mental-models>`; retain strips that injection like recall blocks.
- Seed `max_tokens` stays lean (600 prefs / 800 project) so inject does not dominate every turn (see [coding-memory-evaluation.md](coding-memory-evaluation.md)).
- Template triggers use `mode: delta`, `refresh_after_consolidation: true`, observation-first refresh, and `exclude_mental_models` (oh-my-pi / Claude Code pattern).

## What not to seed

- Secrets, credentials, private URLs
- One-off session status
- Speculative personality profiles
- Project facts in the user bank (and vice versa for coding vs conversation mismatch)
